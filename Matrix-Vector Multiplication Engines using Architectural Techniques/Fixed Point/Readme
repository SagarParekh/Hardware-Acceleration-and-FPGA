Question:

Based upon the test vectors generated from rand(), design and apply a fixed-point data format to the system in Task 3 and test your design again. Notice the precision loss of the fixed-point result 𝑦𝑦􀷜 as comparing to the floating-point result 𝑦𝑦 due to the quantization effect. What is the optimal fixed-point data format that could guarantee an average mean square error (MSE) of <0.1%?
