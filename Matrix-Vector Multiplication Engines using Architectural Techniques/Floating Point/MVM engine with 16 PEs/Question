Prototype a double-precision floating-point MVM engine with 16 PEs in parallel. For handling a vector length of 64, an interleaving factor of 4 is needed. Test your design with random matrices 𝑨𝑨∈ℝ64×64and random vectors 𝑥𝑥∈ℝ64 generated from MATLAB function rand(). You should compare the results of your hardware model against that of MATLAB codes. Since the double-precision data format is used, the results should match with a high precision. In this architecture, what is the minimum clock frequency required for achieving the target throughput? What is the loop latency (P2+P3) required for the correct functionality?
