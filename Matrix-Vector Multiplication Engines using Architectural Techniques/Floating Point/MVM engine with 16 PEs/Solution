In this question as shown above we have an architecture such that it has 16 PEâ€™s in parallel in order to process 64 channels of input. For this reason, we need an interleaving factor of 4. By this what we mean is that It need to store 4 channels of products in the feedback loop. Hence, we need at leas 4 registers to store the data.

But over here the floating-point unit has an inherit latency of 9 so we can have a latency of 9 and thus we can have an interleaving factor up to 9. But we only require 4 cycles for this problem and thus we will have to waste the first 5 cycles.

From this observation we can say that we can feed our column of data every 9 cycles and in every cycle, we can feed 16 elements. It takes 4 cycles to feed 64 elements and we can feed out column after wasting 5 channels in every cycle. So we can get valid 64 elements after every 9x64 cycles i.e. 576 cycles.

Loop latency is P2+P3 which is 9.

Minimum frequency can be evaluated as f >=(n/m) throughput.

Here if we calculate with our given throughput which is 31.56 M, we get f>=284.04MHz.
