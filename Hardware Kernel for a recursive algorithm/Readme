Objective

You will design a hardware kernel for a simple recursive
algorithm using an optimized number format. The function to be implemented is
defined as 𝑧𝑧 = 𝑥𝑥100 + 𝑥𝑥99 + ⋯ + 𝑥𝑥2 + 𝑥𝑥, which can be calculated by the following
recursive algorithm:
                            𝑦 = 1;
                            𝑧 = 0;
                            for (𝑖 = 1; 𝑖 ≤ 100; 𝑖 = 𝑖 + 1) {
                                    𝑦 = 𝑦 × 𝑥;
                                    𝑧 = 𝑧 + 𝑦;
                            }.

Note that both the operations inside the for loop have loop-carried data
dependency.
